A collection of all my stacks in one place for easier management and recreation/restoration.

- PiHoles
  - PiHole 1 (on Pi4-8gb, portainer local)
  - PiHole 2 (on Pi5)
- Wordpress Sites
  - VMA
  - GHI
- Wireguard Easy (wg-easy)
- My Apps
  - DynamicSecrets
  - MyAspNetCoreApp (x64)
  - MyBlazorApp (x64)
  - NuGet Mocker (x64)
- Watchtower

> These setups are not intended to be demos; the port, volume, networking and secrets are configured for my needs. However, they can be replicated as long as you substitute your values for any secrets or stack env vars.
